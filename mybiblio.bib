 abstract = {Shapiro and Wilk's (1965) W statistic arguably provides the best omnibus test of normality, but is currently limited to sample sizes between 3 and 50. W is extended up to n = 2000 and an approximate normalizing transformation suitable for computer implementation is given. A novel application of W in transforming data to normality is suggested, using the three-parameter lognormal as an example.},
